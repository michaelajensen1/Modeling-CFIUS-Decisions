# Modeling CFIUS Decisions
This data analysis and modeling project was undertaken as part of my master's thesis in international relations. In short, this project uses logistic regression and random forest models of a dataset of CFIUS-reviewed transactions to look for country-based and trade war bias in CFIUS review outcomes.
